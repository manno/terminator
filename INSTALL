It's strongly recommended to install Terminator using your OS's package
system rather than using setup.py yourself.  You can find instructions
for many distributions at:

  https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html

If you don't have this option, please make sure you satisfy Terminator's
dependencies yourself:

 * Python 2.5+, 2.6 recommended:
     Debian/Ubuntu: python
     FreeBSD: lang/python26

 * Python VTE bindings:
     Debian/Ubuntu: python-vte
     FreeBSD: x11-toolkits/py-vte

 * Python PyParsing library (only required for Tmux mode):
     Debian/Ubuntu: python-pyparsing
     FreeBSD: devel/py-pyparsing

If you don't care about native language support or icons, Terminator
should run just fine directly from this directory, just:

    ./terminator --help

And go from there.  Manpages are available in the 'doc' directory.

To install properly, run:

    ./setup.py install --record=install-files.txt

See --help for an overview of the available options; e.g. --prefix to
install to a custom base directory, and --without-gettext to avoid
installing natural language support files.

setup.py supports basic uninstallation provided --record was used for
installation as above:

    ./setup.py uninstall --manifest=install-files.txt

Note that uninstall will avoid removing most empty directories so it
won't harm e.g. locale or icon directories which only contain Terminator
data.  It also won't rebuild the icon cache, so you may wish to:

     gtk-update-icon-cache -q -f ${PREFIX}/share/icons/hicolor

Where ${PREFIX} is the base install directory; e.g. /usr/local.
